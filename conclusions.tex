The discovery of a scalar boson at the LHC
strengthened the interest for searches of extension of the scalar sector of the Standard Model.
A vast variety of searches have been performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaboration, using the data collected during the Run 1.  Thanks to proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV, the data collected in 2015 allowed the LHC collaborations to extend the reach in sensitivity in the searches for Higgs bosons beyond the SM. Searches for additional Higgs bosons performed so far have shown consistency with the SM predictions, although the data that will be collected in the next few years can enlighten the nature of the Higgs sector.
