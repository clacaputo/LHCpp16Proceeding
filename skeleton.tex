\abstract{The discovery of the a scalar particle at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is one of the major achivements by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. Important questions on the nature of this new boson and on possible extensions of the scalar sector of the Standard Model have been addressed by both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations with a vast variety of searches performed  at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and 8 TeV (LHC Run 1). Thanks to the first LHC collision at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV (LHC Run 2), new searches which go beyond the Run 1 reach, have been performed by the LHC collaborations. Among them we describe the searches for  $A/H\rightarrow\tau\tau$ and $H\rightarrow hh$ in this proceeding. }
