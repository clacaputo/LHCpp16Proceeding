\abstract{The discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is one of the major achievements of the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. Important questions on the nature of this new boson and on possible extensions of the scalar sector of the Standard Model have been tested by both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations with a vast variety of searches performed  at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and 8 TeV (LHC Run 1). New searches, surpassing the Run 1 sensitivities, have been performed by the LHC collaborations with the proton proton collision data collected in 2015 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Two examples, the searches for $A/H\rightarrow\tau\tau$ and $H\rightarrow hh$, have been selected for a detailed description in these proceedings. }
