In the current study, the measured production and decay rates of the observed Higgs boson in the $\gamma$$\gamma$, ZZ, W W , Z$\gamma$, bb, $\tau$ $\tau$ , and $\mu$$\mu$ decay channels, along with results from the associated production of a Higgs boson with a top-quark pair, are used to probe the scaling of the couplings with mass. Limits are set on parameters in extensions of the Standard Model including a composite Higgs boson, an additional electroweak singlet, and two-Higgs-doublet models. Together with the measured mass of the scalar Higgs boson in the $\gamma$$\gamma$ and ZZ decay modes, a lower limit is set on the pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass of m                                                  A                                         > 370 GeV in the ``hMSSM'' simplified Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. Results from direct searches for heavy Higgs bosons are also interpreted in the hMSSM. Direct searches for invisible Higgs boson decays in the vector-boson fusion and associated production of a Higgs boson with W/Z (Z {\textrightarrow} ℓℓ, W/Z {\textrightarrow} jj) modes are statistically combined to set an upper limit on the Higgs boson invisible branching ratio of 0.25. The use of the measured visible decay rates in a more general coupling fit improves the upper limit to 0.23, constraining a Higgs portal model of dark matter.

This signature is sensitive to the Higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with large values of the parameter tan $\beta$. The analysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb−1. The results are combined with a previous analysis based on 7 TeV data. No signal is observed. Stringent upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction are derived for Higgs bosons with masses up to 900 GeV, and the results are interpreted within different MSSM benchmark scenarios, m                                                  h                  max                , m                                                  h                  mod{\thinspace}+                , m                                                  h                  mod{\thinspace}−                , light-stau and light-stop.
